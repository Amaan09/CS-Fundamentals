## Software Engineering

**1.  What is Software Engineering and why do we need it ? (HR Question)**

**Software Engineering**

Software is a program or set of programs containing instructions which provide desired functionality . And Engineering is the processes of designing and building something that serves a particular purpose and find a cost effective solution to problems. 

    Software Engineering is a systematic approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system.

**Importance of Software Engineering**

1. Reduces complexity

Big softwares are always complex and difficult to develop. Software engineering has a great solution to decrease the complexity of any project. Software engineering divides big problems into several small problems. And then start solving each small problem one by one. All these small problems are solved independently to each other.

2. To minimize software cost

Software requires a lot of hardwork and software engineers are highly paid professionals. A lots of man force is requires to develop software with millions of codes. But in software engineering, programmers plan everything and reduce all those things that are not required. In turn, cost for software productions becomes less as compared to any software that does not use software engineering approach.

3. To decrease time

Anything that is not made according to the plan always wastes time. And if you are making big software then you may need to run many code to get the ultimate running code. This is a very time consuming process and if it is not well managed then this can take a lot of time. So if you are making your software according to software engineering approach then it will reduce a lot of time.

4. Handling big projects

Big projects are not made in few days and they require lots of patience, planning and management. And to invest six and seven months of any company, it requires lots of planning, direction, testing and maintenance. No one can say that he has given four months of company to the project and the program is still in its first stage. Because company has given many resources to the projects and it should be completed. So to handle big projects without any problem, company has to go for software engineering approach.

5. Reliable software

Software should be reliable, means if you have delivered the software then it should work for at least it’s given time span or subscription. And if any bugs come in the software then company is responsible for solving all these bugs. Because in software engineering, testing and maintenance is provided so there is no worry of its reliability.

6. Effectiveness

Effectiveness comes if anything has made according to the standards. Software standards are the big focus of companies to make it more effective. So Software becomes more effective in performance with the help of software engineering.

**2.  Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

    SDLC is the acronym of Software Development Life Cycle.

    It is also called as Software Development Process.

    SDLC is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process.

    ISO/IEC 12207 is an international standard for software life-cycle processes. It aims to be the standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and maintaining software.

What is SDLC?

SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.

The following figure is a graphical representation of the various stages of a typical SDLC.
Stages of SDLC

A typical Software Development Life Cycle consists of the following stages −

**Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis**

Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. It is performed by the senior members of the team with inputs from the customer, the sales department, market surveys and domain experts in the industry. This information is then used to plan the basic project approach and to conduct product feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas.

Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the project is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks.

**Stage 2: Defining Requirements**

Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

**Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture**

SRS is the reference for product architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed. Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification.

This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.

A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its communication and data flow representation with the external and third party modules (if any). The internal design of all the modules of the proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the minutest of the details in DDS.

**Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product**

In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. The programming code is generated as per DDS during this stage. If the design is performed in a detailed and organized manner, code generation can be accomplished without much hassle.

Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code. Different high level programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP are used for coding. The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.

**Stage 5: Testing the Product**

This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. However, this stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.

**Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance**

Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate market. Sometimes product deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of that organization. The product may first be released in a limited segment and tested in the real business environment (UAT- User acceptance testing).

Then based on the feedback, the product may be released as it is or with suggested enhancements in the targeting market segment. After the product is released in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.

**3.  SDLC Models (Important)**

There are various software development life cycle models defined and designed which are followed during the software development process. These models are also referred as Software Development Process Models". Each process model follows a Series of steps unique to its type to ensure success in the process of software development.

Following are the most important and popular SDLC models followed in the industry −

    Waterfall Model
    Iterative Model
    Spiral Model
    V-Model
    Big Bang Model

Other related methodologies are Agile Model, RAD Model, Rapid Application Development and Prototyping Models.

**4.  Waterfall Model , V Model , Iterative Model , Spiral Model and Agile Model(Important)**

**Waterfall Model**

![Image Waterfall Model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_waterfall_model.jpg)

Waterfall approach was first SDLC Model to be used widely in Software Engineering to ensure success of the project. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

The following illustration is a representation of the different phases of the Waterfall Model.
SDLC Waterfall Model

The sequential phases in Waterfall model are −

    Requirement Gathering and analysis − All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in this phase and documented in a requirement specification document.

    System Design − The requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and the system design is prepared. This system design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and helps in defining the overall system architecture.

    Implementation − With inputs from the system design, the system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is referred to as Unit Testing.

    Integration and Testing − All the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.

    Deployment of system − Once the functional and non-functional testing is done; the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.

    Maintenance − There are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues, patches are released. Also to enhance the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.

All these phases are cascaded to each other in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases. The next phase is started only after the defined set of goals are achieved for previous phase and it is signed off, so the name "Waterfall Model". In this model, phases do not overlap.

Waterfall Model - Application

Every software developed is different and requires a suitable SDLC approach to be followed based on the internal and external factors. Some situations where the use of Waterfall model is most appropriate are −

    Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed.

    Product definition is stable.

    Technology is understood and is not dynamic.

    There are no ambiguous requirements.

    Ample resources with required expertise are available to support the product.

    The project is short.


**Iterative Model**

![Image ITR Model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_iterative_model.jpg)

Iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the full system is implemented. At each iteration, design modifications are made and new functional capabilities are added. The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental).

SDLC Iterative Model

Iterative and Incremental development is a combination of both iterative design or iterative method and incremental build model for development. "During software development, more than one iteration of the software development cycle may be in progress at the same time." This process may be described as an "evolutionary acquisition" or "incremental build" approach."

In this incremental model, the whole requirement is divided into various builds. During each iteration, the development module goes through the requirements, design, implementation and testing phases. Each subsequent release of the module adds function to the previous release. The process continues till the complete system is ready as per the requirement.

The key to a successful use of an iterative software development lifecycle is rigorous validation of requirements, and verification & testing of each version of the software against those requirements within each cycle of the model. As the software evolves through successive cycles, tests must be repeated and extended to verify each version of the software.
Iterative Model - Application

Like other SDLC models, Iterative and incremental development has some specific applications in the software industry. This model is most often used in the following scenarios −

    Requirements of the complete system are clearly defined and understood.

    Major requirements must be defined; however, some functionalities or requested enhancements may evolve with time.

    There is a time to the market constraint.

    A new technology is being used and is being learnt by the development team while working on the project.

    Resources with needed skill sets are not available and are planned to be used on contract basis for specific iterations.

    There are some high-risk features and goals which may change in the future.


**Spiral Model**

![Image ITR Model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_spiral_model.jpg)

The spiral model combines the idea of iterative development with the systematic, controlled aspects of the waterfall model. This Spiral model is a combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model i.e. the waterfall model with a very high emphasis on risk analysis. It allows incremental releases of the product or incremental refinement through each iteration around the spiral.

The spiral model has four phases. A software project repeatedly passes through these phases in iterations called Spirals.
Identification

This phase starts with gathering the business requirements in the baseline spiral. In the subsequent spirals as the product matures, identification of system requirements, subsystem requirements and unit requirements are all done in this phase.

This phase also includes understanding the system requirements by continuous communication between the customer and the system analyst. At the end of the spiral, the product is deployed in the identified market.
Design

The Design phase starts with the conceptual design in the baseline spiral and involves architectural design, logical design of modules, physical product design and the final design in the subsequent spirals.
Construct or Build

The Construct phase refers to production of the actual software product at every spiral. In the baseline spiral, when the product is just thought of and the design is being developed a POC (Proof of Concept) is developed in this phase to get customer feedback.

Then in the subsequent spirals with higher clarity on requirements and design details a working model of the software called build is produced with a version number. These builds are sent to the customer for feedback.
Evaluation and Risk Analysis

Risk Analysis includes identifying, estimating and monitoring the technical feasibility and management risks, such as schedule slippage and cost overrun. After testing the build, at the end of first iteration, the customer evaluates the software and provides feedback.

Based on the customer evaluation, the software development process enters the next iteration and subsequently follows the linear approach to implement the feedback suggested by the customer. The process of iterations along the spiral continues throughout the life of the software.
Spiral Model Application

The Spiral Model is widely used in the software industry as it is in sync with the natural development process of any product, i.e. learning with maturity which involves minimum risk for the customer as well as the development firms.

The following pointers explain the typical uses of a Spiral Model −

    When there is a budget constraint and risk evaluation is important.

    For medium to high-risk projects.

    Long-term project commitment because of potential changes to economic priorities as the requirements change with time.

    Customer is not sure of their requirements which is usually the case.

    Requirements are complex and need evaluation to get clarity.

    New product line which should be released in phases to get enough customer feedback.

    Significant changes are expected in the product during the development cycle.


**V Model**

![Image V](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_v_model.jpg)

The V-model is an SDLC model where execution of processes happens in a sequential manner in a V-shape. It is also known as Verification and Validation model.

The V-Model is an extension of the waterfall model and is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage. This means that for every single phase in the development cycle, there is a directly associated testing phase. This is a highly-disciplined model and the next phase starts only after completion of the previous phase.

Under the V-Model, the corresponding testing phase of the development phase is planned in parallel. So, there are Verification phases on one side of the ‘V’ and Validation phases on the other side. The Coding Phase joins the two sides of the V-Model.

V-Model - Verification Phases

There are several Verification phases in the V-Model, each of these are explained in detail below.
Business Requirement Analysis

This is the first phase in the development cycle where the product requirements are understood from the customer’s perspective. This phase involves detailed communication with the customer to understand his expectations and exact requirement. This is a very important activity and needs to be managed well, as most of the customers are not sure about what exactly they need. The acceptance test design planning is done at this stage as business requirements can be used as an input for acceptance testing.
System Design

Once you have the clear and detailed product requirements, it is time to design the complete system. The system design will have the understanding and detailing the complete hardware and communication setup for the product under development. The system test plan is developed based on the system design. Doing this at an earlier stage leaves more time for the actual test execution later.
Architectural Design

Architectural specifications are understood and designed in this phase. Usually more than one technical approach is proposed and based on the technical and financial feasibility the final decision is taken. The system design is broken down further into modules taking up different functionality. This is also referred to as High Level Design (HLD).

The data transfer and communication between the internal modules and with the outside world (other systems) is clearly understood and defined in this stage. With this information, integration tests can be designed and documented during this stage.
Module Design

In this phase, the detailed internal design for all the system modules is specified, referred to as Low Level Design (LLD). It is important that the design is compatible with the other modules in the system architecture and the other external systems. The unit tests are an essential part of any development process and helps eliminate the maximum faults and errors at a very early stage. These unit tests can be designed at this stage based on the internal module designs.
Coding Phase

The actual coding of the system modules designed in the design phase is taken up in the Coding phase. The best suitable programming language is decided based on the system and architectural requirements.

The coding is performed based on the coding guidelines and standards. The code goes through numerous code reviews and is optimized for best performance before the final build is checked into the repository.
Validation Phases

The different Validation Phases in a V-Model are explained in detail below.
Unit Testing

Unit tests designed in the module design phase are executed on the code during this validation phase. Unit testing is the testing at code level and helps eliminate bugs at an early stage, though all defects cannot be uncovered by unit testing.
Integration Testing

Integration testing is associated with the architectural design phase. Integration tests are performed to test the coexistence and communication of the internal modules within the system.
System Testing

System testing is directly associated with the system design phase. System tests check the entire system functionality and the communication of the system under development with external systems. Most of the software and hardware compatibility issues can be uncovered during this system test execution.
Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing is associated with the business requirement analysis phase and involves testing the product in user environment. Acceptance tests uncover the compatibility issues with the other systems available in the user environment. It also discovers the non-functional issues such as load and performance defects in the actual user environment.

V- Model ─ Application

V- Model application is almost the same as the waterfall model, as both the models are of sequential type. Requirements have to be very clear before the project starts, because it is usually expensive to go back and make changes. This model is used in the medical development field, as it is strictly a disciplined domain.

The following pointers are some of the most suitable scenarios to use the V-Model application.

    Requirements are well defined, clearly documented and fixed.

    Product definition is stable.

    Technology is not dynamic and is well understood by the project team.

    There are no ambiguous or undefined requirements.

    The project is short.

**Big-Bang Model**

The Big Bang model is an SDLC model where we do not follow any specific process. The development just starts with the required money and efforts as the input, and the output is the software developed which may or may not be as per customer requirement. This Big Bang Model does not follow a process/procedure and there is a very little planning required. Even the customer is not sure about what exactly he wants and the requirements are implemented on the fly without much analysis.

Usually this model is followed for small projects where the development teams are very small.

The Big Bang Model comprises of focusing all the possible resources in the software development and coding, with very little or no planning. The requirements are understood and implemented as they come. Any changes required may or may not need to revamp the complete software.

This model is ideal for small projects with one or two developers working together and is also useful for academic or practice projects. It is an ideal model for the product where requirements are not well understood and the final release date is not given.

**Agile Model**

![Image V](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_agile_model.jpg)

Agile SDLC model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product. Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations. Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks. Every iteration involves cross functional teams working simultaneously on various areas like −

    Planning
    Requirements Analysis
    Design
    Coding
    Unit Testing and
    Acceptance Testing.

At the end of the iteration, a working product is displayed to the customer and important stakeholders.
What is Agile?

Agile model believes that every project needs to be handled differently and the existing methods need to be tailored to best suit the project requirements. In Agile, the tasks are divided to time boxes (small time frames) to deliver specific features for a release.

Iterative approach is taken and working software build is delivered after each iteration. Each build is incremental in terms of features; the final build holds all the features required by the customer.

Here is a graphical illustration of the Agile Model −
SDLC Agile Model

The Agile thought process had started early in the software development and started becoming popular with time due to its flexibility and adaptability.

The most popular Agile methods include Rational Unified Process (1994), Scrum (1995), Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming (1996), Adaptive Software Development, Feature Driven Development, and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) (1995). These are now collectively referred to as Agile Methodologies, after the Agile Manifesto was published in 2001.

Following are the Agile Manifesto principles −

    Individuals and interactions − In Agile development, self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming.

    Working software − Demo working software is considered the best means of communication with the customers to understand their requirements, instead of just depending on documentation.

    Customer collaboration − As the requirements cannot be gathered completely in the beginning of the project due to various factors, continuous customer interaction is very important to get proper product requirements.

    Responding to change − Agile Development is focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.

Agile Vs Traditional SDLC Models

Agile is based on the adaptive software development methods, whereas the traditional SDLC models like the waterfall model is based on a predictive approach. Predictive teams in the traditional SDLC models usually work with detailed planning and have a complete forecast of the exact tasks and features to be delivered in the next few months or during the product life cycle.

Predictive methods entirely depend on the requirement analysis and planning done in the beginning of cycle. Any changes to be incorporated go through a strict change control management and prioritization.

Agile uses an adaptive approach where there is no detailed planning and there is clarity on future tasks only in respect of what features need to be developed. There is feature driven development and the team adapts to the changing product requirements dynamically. The product is tested very frequently, through the release iterations, minimizing the risk of any major failures in future.

Customer Interaction is the backbone of this Agile methodology, and open communication with minimum documentation are the typical features of Agile development environment. The agile teams work in close collaboration with each other and are most often located in the same geographical location.

Agile Model - Pros and Cons

Agile methods are being widely accepted in the software world recently. However, this method may not always be suitable for all products. Here are some pros and cons of the Agile model.

The advantages of the Agile Model are as follows −

    Is a very realistic approach to software development.

    Promotes teamwork and cross training.

    Functionality can be developed rapidly and demonstrated.

    Resource requirements are minimum.

    Suitable for fixed or changing requirements

    Delivers early partial working solutions.

    Good model for environments that change steadily.

    Minimal rules, documentation easily employed.

    Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context.

    Little or no planning required.

    Easy to manage.

    Gives flexibility to developers.

The disadvantages of the Agile Model are as follows −

    Not suitable for handling complex dependencies.

    More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.

    An overall plan, an agile leader and agile PM practice is a must without which it will not work.

    Strict delivery management dictates the scope, functionality to be delivered, and adjustments to meet the deadlines.

    Depends heavily on customer interaction, so if customer is not clear, team can be driven in the wrong direction.

    There is a very high individual dependency, since there is minimum documentation generated.

    Transfer of technology to new team members may be quite challenging due to lack of documentation.


**RAD Model**

![Image V](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_rad_model.jpg)

The RAD (Rapid Application Development) model is based on prototyping and iterative development with no specific planning involved. The process of writing the software itself involves the planning required for developing the product.

Rapid Application Development focuses on gathering customer requirements through workshops or focus groups, early testing of the prototypes by the customer using iterative concept, reuse of the existing prototypes (components), continuous integration and rapid delivery.
What is RAD?

Rapid application development is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. A prototype is a working model that is functionally equivalent to a component of the product.

In the RAD model, the functional modules are developed in parallel as prototypes and are integrated to make the complete product for faster product delivery. Since there is no detailed preplanning, it makes it easier to incorporate the changes within the development process.

RAD projects follow iterative and incremental model and have small teams comprising of developers, domain experts, customer representatives and other IT resources working progressively on their component or prototype.

The most important aspect for this model to be successful is to make sure that the prototypes developed are reusable.
RAD Model Design

RAD model distributes the analysis, design, build and test phases into a series of short, iterative development cycles.

Following are the various phases of the RAD Model −
Business Modelling

The business model for the product under development is designed in terms of flow of information and the distribution of information between various business channels. A complete business analysis is performed to find the vital information for business, how it can be obtained, how and when is the information processed and what are the factors driving successful flow of information.
Data Modelling

The information gathered in the Business Modelling phase is reviewed and analyzed to form sets of data objects vital for the business. The attributes of all data sets is identified and defined. The relation between these data objects are established and defined in detail in relevance to the business model.
Process Modelling

The data object sets defined in the Data Modelling phase are converted to establish the business information flow needed to achieve specific business objectives as per the business model. The process model for any changes or enhancements to the data object sets is defined in this phase. Process descriptions for adding, deleting, retrieving or modifying a data object are given.
Application Generation

The actual system is built and coding is done by using automation tools to convert process and data models into actual prototypes.
Testing and Turnover

The overall testing time is reduced in the RAD model as the prototypes are independently tested during every iteration. However, the data flow and the interfaces between all the components need to be thoroughly tested with complete test coverage. Since most of the programming components have already been tested, it reduces the risk of any major issues.
 
**5.  Quality assurance and testing (QTE) - If You are Applying for this Post then You Should have Knowledge about BlackBox and Whitebox Testing.**

Software Testing can be majorly classified into two categories: 
 

    Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester 
     
    White Box Testing is a software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. 
     

Differences between Black Box Testing vs White Box Testing: 

It is a way of software testing in which the internal structure or the program or the code is hidden and nothing is known about it.   It is a way of testing the software in which the tester has knowledge about the internal structure or the code or the program of the software.

It is mostly done by software testers.  It is mostly done by software developers.

No knowledge of implementation is needed.   Knowledge of implementation is required.

It can be referred as outer or external software testing.   It is the inner or the internal software testing.

It is functional test of the software.  It is structural test of the software.

This testing can be initiated on the basis of requirement specifications document.  This type of testing of software is started after detail design document.

No knowledge of programming is required.  It is mandatory to have knowledge of programming.

It is the behavior testing of the software.   It is the logic testing of the software.

It is applicable to the higher levels of testing of software.   It is generally applicable to the lower levels of software testing.

It is also called closed testing.   It is also called as clear box testing.

It is least time consuming.   It is most time consuming.

It is not suitable or preferred for algorithm testing.  It is suitable for algorithm testing.

Can be done by trial and error ways and methods.  Data domains along with inner or internal boundaries can be better tested.

Example: search something on google by using keywords   Example: by input to check and verify loops

Types of Black Box Testing: 
 

    A. Functional Testing 
     
    B. Non-functional testing 
     
    C. Regression Testing

Types of White Box Testing: 
 

    A. Path Testing 
     
    B. Loop Testing 
     
    C. Condition testing


**6.  What is Software Requirement Specification (SRS Document)**

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed. It lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide .

 This document lays a foundation for software engineering activities and is created when entire requirements are elicited and analyzed.

**Advantages** 

Software SRS establishes the basic for agreement between the client and the supplier on what the software product will do.

 

1. A SRS provides a reference for validation of the final product.

2. A high-quality SRS is a prerequisite to high-quality software.

3. A high-quality SRS reduces the development cost. 

**Characteristics of an SRS**

 

1. Correct

2. Complete

3. Unambiguous

4. Verifiable

5. Consistent

6. Ranked for importance and/or stability

7. Modifiable

8. Traceable
